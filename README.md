The Challenge - Clean India
============================

Inspired by [The Ugly Indian](theuglyindian.com) and the [community](https://www.facebook.com/theugl.yindian) who have been transforming public spaces in the country over the past few years, create a software application that empowers people to take charge and solve problems in their neighborhood.


###Why?

 
> "I beg every citizen of the country to pledge 100 hours a year towards cleanliness. This work cannot be done by the PM, CMs or ministers alone. Every citizen of the nation has to pledge to keep the country clean" - Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 24th Sep 2014

If you have been following work inspired by [The Ugly Indian](https://www.facebook.com/theugl.yindian) on facebook, you will see that it takes only a few people to go out and bring about a change. 



###What?


![PM's message to dedicate 2 hours per week to spotfixing](https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t31.0-8/r90/10623637_758609274198330_1043844814865936707_o.jpg?dl=1)

In short do a spot fix - A spotfix is transforming a public space by solving the basic underlying problems

The photos [here](http://theuglyindian.tumblr.com/) and this [Reddit AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/24uw33/hi_rindia_i_am_anamik_nagrik_an_ugly_indian_ama_r/?sort=top) cover most questions you will have about this approach and proactive style of working. 

There is even a book on this [here](http://theuglyindian.com/books/)



###How?


Create an application (mobile or web) that enables people from across the country to plan, organize and execute a spot fix. 

###Who and Where?


Anyone from any part of the country can participate. The entire process is online. You can do this as an individual or find a team to build this. 

###When?


September 24 - Oct 1

We need you to complete your application and submit it by 11:00 PM on 1st October 2014 IST.


###What do you get out of this?

You can create an application that can inspire an entire generation of Indians to *see the change they want to be*. 

The best entries will be showcased, promoted and used by people who have been inspired by 'The Ugly Indian'

###Submission

- You will have to email indiarisingtech@gmail.com with a link to the working version of your application along with brief details on how to use it and some screenshots.
- If you have your code on github, submit a pull request to this repository.
 

###Requirements


- You can build either a mobile or a web application. There are no restrictions on the platform you can build. All we care about is that whatever you build works, is easy to use and has the potential to have mass appeal.

The primary functional requirements for the app include
- **Planning a spot fix** | Any person who is interested to do a spot fix should be able to upload a photo, location and description of the spot along with a planned date she or he intends to fix it on.
- **Joining a spot fix** | Any person should be able to browse through planned spot fixes in their vicinity and be able to join the spotfix and share the fix across social media.
- **Reporting a spot fix** | Any person should be able to report a spot fix after it has been completed. The user should be able to upload a before/after picture, a geotagged location, a date and a description of the fix.
- **Map based dashboard** | The primary interface should be map based that shows spots that are available for a fix and spots that have been fixed. The dashboard should let users navigate to each of the spots and browse the details. The dashboard should also report metrics like - Total number of hours volunteered, total number of spot fixes and other interesting aggregated metrics.
